## 🚀 Live Access & Development Server
The application is pre-configured and ready to run in any environment:

### Option A: 100% Vercel Ready (One-Click or CLI)
This project includes pre-configured **[`vercel.json`](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/zahid/vercel.json)**, Vercel Serverless Function **[`api/contact.js`](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/zahid/api/contact.js)**, and automatic dynamic base path resolution:

```bash
# Method 1: Deploy with Vercel CLI
npx vercel

# Method 2: Deploy for Production
npx vercel --prod
```
Or simply push this folder to a GitHub repository and import it into [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new). Vercel will auto-detect Vite, build `dist/`, and deploy the serverless functions with 0 configuration.

### Option B: Modern Node / Vite Development Server (Active)
```bash
# Start Vite Development Server with Hot-Module-Reloading
npm run dev
# Accessible at: http://localhost:5173/
```

### Option C: Apache / XAMPP (Local Hosting)
Since this project is situated in `C:\xampp\htdocs\zahid`, it is pre-built with `index.php` and an `assets/` bundle:
1. Start **Apache** from the XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Navigate in any browser to: `http://localhost/zahid/`
3. All assets, images, and the PHP contact endpoint (`api/contact.php`) will serve natively.

### Option C: Production Build & Static Cloud Deployment
```bash
# Build optimized production bundle to dist/
npm run build
```
Deploy the generated `dist/` directory directly to Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3 / CloudFront, or any Apache/Nginx web server.

* **Source:** `public/zahid-iqbal.jpg` (also accessible as `./zahid-iqbal.jpg`)
* **Portrait & Bust Crops:** Available in `public/assets/images/`
* **Composition:** Framed in a multi-layered telemetry HUD with cyan-blue glowing rim, interactive reticle brackets, live telemetry chips (`STATUS: ACTIVE`, `15+ YRS EXPERIENCE`, `NOC L4 LEAD`), and a subtle dark bottom vignette that smoothly anchors into the deep midnight canvas.
* **To Replace the Photo:** Simply replace `public/zahid-iqbal.jpg` or modify the file path in the built-in CMS panel (`CMS` button in the navbar).
